  <h2>What We Can Do for You</h2>
  <p>We're here to help you protect what matters. That starts with building a custom roadmap-a plan designed around your life, your needs, and your goals. Whether you're looking to start fresh or improve what you already have, we'll walk you through every step.</p>
  <p>Here's how we help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Build a Map:</strong> We look at where you are now and where you're headed-retirement, emergencies, family growth-and help you plan for each key "junction."</li>
    <li><strong>New Plans:</strong> We'll help you start new coverage that fits your lifestyle, budget, and needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Protection:</strong> Missing coverage in areas like Critical Illness or Long-Term Care? We'll show you how to fill the gaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Compare Plans:</strong> Already have coverage? We'll help you compare it with other options to make sure you're getting the best value.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Money:</strong> Many teachers end up overpaying for outdated or redundant coverage. We'll help you tighten up your benefits and potentially lower your monthly premiums.</li>
    <li><strong>Make It Convenient:</strong> We come to you. Whether it's on campus, over video, or a quick call, we keep it simple and stress-free.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our goal is not to push products-it's to help you decide what makes sense. And if now's not the right time? That's okay too. We're here when you're ready.</p>
