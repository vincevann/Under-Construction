  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>At Teacher Benefit Agency, we're not just in the business of insurance-we're in the business of helping teachers prepare for life. We specialize in creating insurance plans built specifically for educators, because we believe your protection should reflect your unique needs and realities.</p>
  <p>We've met with thousands of teachers across California-one-on-one and on your schedule. Whether it's during lunch breaks, after school, or over a quick call, we work around your time. Because we get it-convenience matters. Our goal is to make planning for emergencies and the future simple, accessible, and stress-free.</p>
  <p>Our agents are licensed by the State of California and appointed by top insurance companies. But more importantly, we're people who truly care. We want to be your go-to advisor, your "insurance guy"-someone you trust to give you honest, easy-to-understand advice and guide you without pressure or confusion.</p>
  <p>We use a "map" philosophy-because we're here to help you chart your path. That means preparing you for the junctions in your life: emergencies, retirement, family changes, and more. We focus on building layers of protection-not just life insurance, but benefits that help when you're sick, injured, or need long-term care. These plans can cover lost income, protect your savings, and even give money back if you don't end up needing them.</p>
  <p>Whether you're new to teaching, planning for retirement, or somewhere in between, Teacher Benefit Agency exists to help you feel secure. This is your journey-we're just here to help you drive it with confidence.</p>
