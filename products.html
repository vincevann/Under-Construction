  <h2>Products We Offer</h2>
  <p>We offer carefully selected insurance plans that provide powerful coverage and flexibility. Our focus is on real protection for real risks-plans that do more than sit on paper. Here's a breakdown of what we offer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Critical Illness Insurance:</strong> Helps cover costs from serious diagnoses like heart attack, stroke, or cancer. Many plans come with a lump sum payout and a cash-back option if unused.</li>
    <li><strong>Disability Insurance:</strong> Protects your income if you're unable to work due to injury or illness. Perfect for new hires, maternity coverage, or anyone without many sick days.</li>
    <li><strong>Accident & Hospital Plans:</strong> Covers unexpected events-from falls to hospital stays. Benefits pay out based on the type of treatment, not just your medical bills.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Care (LTC):</strong> Helps you plan for aging or chronic illness care-so your family isn't left to carry the burden alone.</li>
    <li><strong>Life Insurance:</strong> Protects your loved ones financially and can be bundled with savings or investment features. Many of our plans offer cash-back if unused after 25 years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also offer bundled plans with Critical Illness + Life coverage that provide multiple layers of protection and long-term value. If you want to compare your current plan to ours, we'll help you do a benefit vs. cost analysis-side by side, apples to apples.</p>
